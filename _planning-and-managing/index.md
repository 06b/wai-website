This guide outlines activities to help you integrate accessibility
throughout the web production process. This applies to individual
projects and on an organizational level. These activities are not
necessarily carried out in sequence, and are ideally repeated over time
to continually raise the level of accessibility capability.

A companion document, [Web Accessibility First Aid: Approaches for
Interim Repairs](/pages/interim-repairs.md), provides guidance on more
immediate remediation of accessibility barriers in existing websites.
