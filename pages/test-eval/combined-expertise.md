Introduction

{:#intro.no_toc.no_display}

Evaluating the accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities
requires diverse kinds of expertise and perspectives. While it is
possible for individuals to evaluate Web accessibility effectively if
they have training and experience across a broad range of disciplines,
it is less likely that one individual will have all the expertise that a
collaborative approach can bring. 

This document describes: 

-   recommended expertise for evaluating Web accessibility
-   approaches for creating collaborative evaluation processes
-   considerations for effective collaboration in different settings

References to related evaluation resources are mentioned throughout this
document. Most of these resources can be found in this resource suite,
[Evaluating Web Sites for
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html).

Recommended Expertise {#expertise}
----------------------------------

Effective evaluation of Web accessibility requires more than simply
running an evaluation tool on a Web site. Comprehensive and effective
evaluations require evaluators with an understanding of Web
technologies, evaluation tools, barriers that people with disabilities
experience, assistive technologies and approaches that people with
disabilities use, and accessibility guidelines and techniques.

The following list includes recommended expertise across a variety of
areas, and provides links to initial resources, listed at the end of
this document, which may be useful in learning more about those areas.

Approaches for Collaborative Evaluation {#composition}
-------------------------------------------------------

When first conducting a Web accessibility evaluation, the initial
approach in many organizations is to assign the task to an individual
within the organization, or to outsource it. However, many organizations
use a collaborative evaluation process involving the skills and
perspectives of multiple evaluators. This approach allows an
organization to use in-house expertise as well as outside experts where
needed.

Collaborative evaluation processes can involve:

-   a group of colleagues distributed within a larger organization; for
    instance, Web developers from different units of a large corporation
    working together
-   a Web development or quality assurance team within a larger
    organization, which brings in outside experts to help them conduct
    evaluations in the short term and helps them build improved
    capability for in-house evaluation over the long term
-   a small business whose mission is to provide accessibility
    evaluation services, and which does so with a multi-disciplinary
    team
-   disability advocates from different organizations who collaborate in
    online fora to monitor accessibility of Web sites
-   a group of individuals distributed across related organizations such
    as government agencies, each with the obligation to monitor
    accessibility of their own Web site, who combine their diverse
    expertise & perspectives for higher quality evaluations

Considerations in Combining Expertise {#operation}
---------------------------------------------------

### Centralized versus distributed evaluation capability

Organizations with in-house evaluation capacity sometimes use a
centralized group of evaluators, and sometimes use evaluators who are
distributed across the organization. A centralized team can serve as a
resource for the rest of the organization. Evaluation capability that is
distributed across an organization may offer more possibilities for
integrating accessibility work into Web development processes throughout
the organization. It may help in identifying more diverse expertise
since one can look beyond the boundaries of a centralized team. In
addition, it can help in developing a shared organizational mission for
continual improvement of accessibility, rather than leaving oversight of
accessibility as the responsibility of a single office.

### Identification of external expertise

Once gaps in internal expertise are clear, an organization can
prioritize its needs for external expertise. The internal gaps are often
in areas of knowledge specific to disability and/or accessibility; for
instance, Web accessibility guidelines, cross-disability accessibility
barriers, or use of assistive technologies. In addition, even
organizations with established user testing processes may need guidance
on how to get feedback from users with disabilities. It can be valuable
in some cases to bring in more than one outside expert to cover this
range of issues effectively, or to look for feedback in online
communities focusing on Web accessibility.

### Involving users in evaluation

Inclusion of people with disabilities in a collaborative group can
contribute to a better understanding of accessibility issues within the
organization, and/or to maintaining awareness of the urgency of
addressing accessibility barriers on a site, in addition to their
individual technical contributions to the evaluation.

Regardless of the collective expertise of a collaborative group of
evaluators in conducting conformance evaluations, an organization may
want to ensure periodic review by users with a variety of disabilities.
There are many factors to consider in effectively [involving users in
Web accessibility evaluations](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html),
including ensuring diversity in disabilities represented, types of
assistive technology used, and experience with the Web.

### Facilitating collaboration through shared tools and templates

A group of evaluators may want to arrange for shared access to certain
evaluation tools, or to ensure that they have access to a [broad range
of evaluation tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html) across
the group as a whole.

Using an agreed-upon template for reporting the results of evaluations
can greatly facilitate coordination between different evaluators. Such a
template might be an adaptation of the [Template for Accessibility
Evaluation Reports](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/template.html).

### Communicating results

Collaborative teams may want to give particular attention to
communicating the results of their evaluations to their customers
clearly, since their reports represent the combined perspectives of
different evaluators. 

### Getting and giving feedback

Providing a mechanism for feedback within an organization on the
usefulness of the evaluation process and resulting report may assist
collaborative evaluators in ongoing identification of gaps in expertise,
and contribute to long-term improvement in the quality of evaluations.

Feedback from experienced groups of evaluators on evaluation resources
such as W3C/WAI's resource suite [Evaluating Web Sites for
Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/) can, over time, also help
improve the quality of evaluation support resources available to the
broader Web community. Feedback links are available in the footers of
pages in this Evaluation resource suite.
