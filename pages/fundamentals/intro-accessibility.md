  <h2><a name="i-what" id="i-what" shape="rect">What is Web Accessibility</a></h2>
  <p><strong>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web</strong>.
    More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can  contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including <a href="../bcase/soc.html#of" shape="rect">older people</a> with changing abilities due to aging.</p>
  <p>Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that  affect access to the Web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The document "<strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview.html" shape="rect">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a></strong>" describes how different
    disabilities affect Web use and includes scenarios of people with
    disabilities using the Web.

  <p></p>
  <p>Millions of people  have disabilities that affect their use
    of the Web. Currently most Web sites and <a href="#software" shape="rect">Web software</a> have <strong>accessibility barriers</strong> that make it
    difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use the Web. As more accessible Web sites and  software become available, people with disabilities are able to use and contribute to the Web more effectively.</p>
  <p>Web accessibility  also <strong>benefits</strong> people <em>without</em> disabilities. For example, a key  principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software that are flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This <strong>flexibility</strong> also benefits people <em>without</em> disabilities in certain situations, such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging. The document "<a href="../bcase/Overview" shape="rect">Developing a
    Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization</a>" describes  many different benefits of Web accessibility, including <strong>benefits for organizations</strong>.</p>
  <h2><a name="important" id="important" shape="rect">Why Web Accessibility is
    Important</a></h2>
  <p>The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide <strong>equal access</strong> and <strong>equal opportunity</strong> to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help people with disabilities more actively participate  in society.</p>
  <p>The Web offers the possibility of <strong>unprecedented access to information and interaction</strong> for many people with disabilities. That is, the  accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through Web technologies.</p>
  <p>The document "<a href="../bcase/soc" shape="rect">Social Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization</a>" discusses  how the Web  impacts the lives of people with disabilities, the overlap with digital divide issues, and Web accessibility as an aspect of corporate social responsibility.</p>
  <p>Another important consideration for organizations is that Web accessibility is required by laws and policies in some cases. <a href="../policy-res" shape="rect">WAI  Web Accessibility Policy Resources</a> links to resources for addressing legal and policy factors within organizations, including a list of relevant <a href="../Policy/" shape="rect">laws and policies around the world</a>.</p>
  <h2><a name="making" id="making" shape="rect">Making the Web Accessible</a></h2>
  <p> Much of the focus on Web accessibility has been on the responsibilities of Web developers. However, <a href="#software" shape="rect">Web software</a> also has a vital role in Web accessibility. Software needs to help developers produce and evaluate accessible Web sites, and be usable by people with disabilities.</p>
  <p>One of the roles of the Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="../about-links" shape="rect">WAI</a>) is to develop <a href="../guid-tech" shape="rect">guidelines and techniques</a> that describe accessibility solutions for Web software and Web developers. These WAI guidelines  are considered the international standard for Web accessibility.</p>
  <p>The document "<a href="components.php" shape="rect"><strong>Essential Components of
    Web Accessibility</strong></a>" describes the different  Web accessibility roles, and how specific improvements could substantially advance Web accessibility.</p>
  <h3><a name="specific" id="specific" shape="rect">Making Your Web Site Accessible</a></h3>
  <p>Making a Web site accessible can be simple or complex, depending on many factors such as the type of <a href="#content" shape="rect">content</a>, the size and complexity of the site, and the
    development tools and environment.</p>
  <p>Many accessibility features are easily implemented if they are planned from the beginning of Web site development or redesign. Fixing inaccessible Web sites can require significant effort, especially sites that were not originally "coded" properly with standard <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> markup, and
    sites with certain types of content such as multimedia.</p>
  <p>The document "<a href="/WAI/impl/Overview" shape="rect">Implementation Plan for Web
    Accessibility</a>" 
    <!-- title of resource might change --> 
    lists basic steps for addressing  accessibility in Web projects. The <a href="wcag.php" shape="rect">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and techniques documents provide detailed information for developers.</p>
  <h3><a name="evaluate" id="evaluate" shape="rect"> Evaluating the Accessibility of a Web Site</a></h3>
  <p>When developing or redesigning a site, evaluating accessibility early and throughout the development process can identify accessibility problems early when it is easier to address them. Simple techniques such as changing settings in a  browser can  determine if a Web page meets some accessibility guidelines. A comprehensive evaluation to determine if a site  meets all accessibility guidelines  is much more complex.</p>
  <p>There are <a href="/WAI/ER/existingtools.html" shape="rect">evaluation  tools</a> that  help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility guidelines. Knowledgeable <strong>human evaluation is required</strong> to determine if a site is accessible.</p>
  <p>The document "<a href="/WAI/eval/Overview.html" shape="rect">Evaluating Web Sites for
    Accessibility</a>"  provides guidance on <a href="/WAI/eval/preliminary" shape="rect">preliminary reviews</a> using techniques to quickly assess some of the accessibility problems on a site. It also provides  general procedures and tips for evaluating <a href="/WAI/eval/conformance" shape="rect">conformance to accessibility guidelines</a>.</p>
  <h2><a id="more-info" name="more-info" shape="rect">For More Information</a></h2>
  <p>The <a href="/WAI/" shape="rect">WAI Web site</a> provides <a href="../guid-tech" shape="rect">guidelines</a> and <a href="/WAI/Resources/" shape="rect"> resources</a> to help make the Web accessible. These range from very short summaries, such as "<a href="/WAI/References/QuickTips/" shape="rect">Quick Tips to
    Make Accessible Web Sites</a>," to resources on <a href="../managing" shape="rect">managing accessibility</a>, to detailed <a href="/TR/tr-activity#WAITechnicalActivity" shape="rect">technical references</a>.</p>
  <p>Related resources for making the Web accessible are also available from other organizations, and many can be found on the Web.</p>
  <h2><a id="terms" name="terms" shape="rect">Terminology</a></h2>
  <p><a name="content" id="content" shape="rect"></a><strong>Web "content"</strong> generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application,
    including text, images, forms, sounds, and such. More specific definitions
    are available in the WCAG documents, which are linked from the <a href="wcag.php" shape="rect">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
  <p><a name="software" id="software" shape="rect"></a><strong>Web software</strong> includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web browsers</strong>, media players, and other "user agents"; for more
      information, see <a href="uaag.php" shape="rect">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
      (UAAG) Overview</a>.</li>
    <!-- add assisitve technologies -->
    <li><strong>Authoring tools</strong> that creates Web sites; for more information see, <a href="atag.php" shape="rect">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)
      Overview</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation tools</strong> that determine if a Web site meets standards and
      guidelines; for a list of accessibility evaluation tools, see <a href="/WAI/ER/existingtools" shape="rect">Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation Tools
      for Web Content Accessibility</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>People with disabilities sometimes use other software, called <strong>assistive technologies</strong>, to interact with the Web.</p>
