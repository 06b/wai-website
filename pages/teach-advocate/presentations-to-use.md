information is for each slide.\]”.

Advice for Presenters {#presenters}
------------------------------------

***See also* important information in [How to Make Presentations Accessible to All](http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible.php).**

-   **Cover all displayed text.** <br>Describe pertinent parts of graphics.
    Remember that some people may not be able to see the slides during
    your presentation, for example, people who are blind or people
    listening to an audio-only recording of the presentation. Make sure
    that you say all of the information that is on each slide. (This
    does not mean that you have to read the slide exactly as it is, just
    that you cover the information in what you say.)
    When graphics or other displayed information is relevant, describe
    them to the extent useful for understanding the presentation.
-   **Customize the presentation for audience and time.** <br>
    Most presentations include slides and notes that are relevant for
    particular audiences, We encourage you to customize the presentation
    based on your audience and the time available. For some
    presentations you might want to delete slides, or add material
    specifically for your audience, for example, links to translations.
    Suggestions for customizing the presentation are included in the
    Notes section of several slides.
-   **Printing the Notes.** <br>
    Most presentation software allows you to print the slides along
    with the notes on the same page. You might need to change the
    margins or font size for all of the notes to fit on a printed page.
    You can also create a word processing version where you can more
    easily reformat the notes, for example, making them in a larger text
    size and putting the notes for one slide on two pages.
-   **Provide handouts.** <br>
    Consider providing copies of the presentation materials for the
    audience. For handouts related to WAI presentations, see [WAI
    Handouts and WAI Flyer](http://www.w3.org/WAI/flyer/Overview%20).
