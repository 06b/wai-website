Summary
-------

-   **Mobile accessibility is covered in existing W3C WAI accessibility
    standards/guidelines**, particularly WCAG and UAAG, which are
    introduced below. There are not separate guidelines for mobile
    accessibility.
-   W3C is developing more specifc and updated guidance on mobile
    accessibility.
-   **WAI's [Mobile Accessibility Task
    Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/) work includes:**
    -   [Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines
        Apply to
        Mobile](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/)

Introduction {#intro}
----------------------

"Mobile accessibility" refers to making websites and applications more
accessible to people with disabilities when they are using mobile phones
and other devices. WAI's work in this area addresses accessibility
issues of people using a broad range of devices to interact with the
web: phones, tablets, TVs, and more.

This page summarizes existing resources and resources under development
that are related to mobile web accessibility.

**[Current Work](#more) is listed below.**

W3C WAI Addresses Mobile Accessibility {#covered}
--------------------------------------------------

**WAI's accessibility guidelines address mobile accessibility**:

-   **[WCAG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)** (Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers web pages and web applications,
    including content used on mobile devices.
    -   **WCAG2ICT** [Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and
        Communications Technologies](http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/)
        coverage includes mobile apps.
    -   To learn how WCAG 2.0 can be applied to mobile web content,
        mobile web apps, native apps, and hybrid apps using web
        components inside native apps, see [**Mobile Accessibility: How
        WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to
        Mobile**](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/).
    -   To learn how WCAG addresses similar issues as Mobile Web Best
        Practices and Mobile Web Application Best Practices, see [Shared
        Web Experiences](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences).
-   **[UAAG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag.php)** (User Agent
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers web browsers and other 'user
    agents', including mobile browsers.
    -   For examples of how web browsers that follow UAAG benefit people
        with disabilities using the Web on mobile devices, see [Mobile
        Accessibility Examples from
        UAAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20/mobile).
    -   A rough draft of [Applying UAAG to Mobile
        Phones](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Applying_UAAG_to_Mobile_Phones)
        is available.
-   **[ATAG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php)** (Authoring Tool
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers software used to create web pages
    and applications, including for mobile.
-   **[WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)** (Accessible
    Rich Internet Applications) defines ways to make web content more
    accessible, especially dynamic content and advanced user interface
    controls.

**W3C addresses mobile accessibility.** WAI ensures that the core W3C
technologies support accessibility, including those that are essential
for the mobile web. All W3C work is reviewed for accessibility by WAI's

Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group
([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)).

W3C work on mobile includes:

-   [Mobile Web Application Best
    Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/), [Mobile Web Best
    Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/), [mobileOK
    Checker](http://validator.w3.org/mobile/)
-   WAI's [IndieUI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/indieui) (Independent
    User Interface) worked on ways for user actions to be communicated
    to web applications, including mobile applications. It is being
    taken up by other W3C groups as described on the [IndieUI home
    page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/).
-   **[Standards for Web Applications on
    Mobile](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/)** summarizes
    technologies developed in W3C that increase the capabilities of web
    applications, and how they apply specifically to the mobile context.

Current Work {#more}
---------------------

WAI's current work related to mobile accessibility includes:

-   **WCAG** techniques and other guidance for designers and developers
    through the [**Mobile Accessibility Task
    Force**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/), including:
    -   [Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines
        Apply to
        Mobile](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/)
    -   Potential new WCAG Success Criteria and Techniques
    -   Other [Current
        Work](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page#Current_Work)
-   **WAI-ARIA** (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) - See the
    [WAI-ARIA Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php) for an
    introduction and links to the draft documents.
-   Reviewing [Standards for Web Applications on
    Mobile](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/) through the
    Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group
    ([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)).

Mobile and Accessibility Overlap {#overlap}
--------------------------------------------

Most of this page addresses people with disabilities using mobile
devices. We also have related resources that address situations such as:
a web development project wants to make their websites and web
applications work better for *all mobile users (including those without
disabilities)* **and also** work better for *users with disabilities
using "traditional" computers*.

-   [**Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web**: Making a Web Site
    Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile
    Devices](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap.html) introduces the
    significant overlap between making a website accessible for a mobile
    device and for people with disabilities. Provides a brief overview
    that is *useful for the [business
    case](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/)*.
-   [**Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users
    and People with
    Disabilities**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences) provides
    examples of barriers that people with disabilities and people using
    mobile devices experience when interacting with web content. It is
    organized by the principles perceivable, operable, understandable,
    and robust, and includes links to the relevant sections of MWBP
    (Mobile Web Best Practices) and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines).
-   [Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web
    Content Accessibility Guidelines
    (WCAG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/) provides guidance for
    people who are familiar with MWBP and want to know how it relates to
    WCAG, or are familiar with WCAG and want to know how it relates to
    MWBP.

About W3C and WAI {#about}
---------------------------

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium where
Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to
develop Web standards. W3C primarily pursues its mission through the
creation of Web standards and guidelines designed to ensure long-term
growth for the Web. To learn more, see [About
W3C](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/).

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together individuals and
organizations from around the world to develop strategies, guidelines,
and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with
disabilities. To learn more, see the [WAI
website](http://www.w3.org/WAI/).
