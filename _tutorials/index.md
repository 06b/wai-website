For example, they show you how to provide accessible images and tables using a variety of web technologies, including HTML4, HTML5, CSS3, WAI-ARIA, MathML, and SVG. The concepts and techniques explained in the tutorials apply to other formats as well.

Web authoring tools (Content Management Systems (CMS), <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors, word processors, etc.) can often help you create content that is accessible as shown in these tutorials.

## Relationship to WCAG 2.0

These tutorials provide best-practice guidance on implementing accessibility in different situations. They combine WCAG 2.0 success criteria and techniques from various conformance levels. Each tutorial page lists the specific success criteria and techniques used on that page. A more comprehensive coverage of the normative  [WCAG 2.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and its supporting materials is provided in **[How to Meet WCAG 2.0: A customizable quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)**.
