[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-act-rules-format-1.1-20240618/) Working Draft is available for review. The ACT Rules Format defines how to write accessibility test rules. This helps manufacturers of automated test tools and creators of manual test methodologies to share their testing procedures and to compare their findings in a more robust and understandable manner. Changes from Rules Format 1.0 include: new secondary accessibility requirements, allowance for subjective applicability statements, and rearrangement of some sections of the Test Rules. Additional changes are in the [Change History](https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-act-rules-format-1.1-20240618/#Change_History). Please submit any comments by 18 August 2024. For an introduction to ACT and related resources, see the [ACT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/).
